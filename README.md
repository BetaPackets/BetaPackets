# BetaPackets
The ultimate standalone Minecraft protocol library for all platforms and all Minecraft versions

### Note: This project is in very early development and not ready for production use!

## Why another protocol library?
The idea of BetaPackets is to develop a protocol library that is not based on any platform, the BetaPackets core is based only on Netty and can be implemented on anything, this ensures that this protocol library works on any server software with the same API.
